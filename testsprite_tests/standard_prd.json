    "Enable users to generate detailed, day-by-day travel itineraries using AI based on destination and duration inputs.",
    "Provide secure user authentication and maintain user-specific itinerary history with CRUD operations.",
    "Integrate interactive maps to visualize travel destinations and itinerary locations dynamically.",
    "Allow users to export itineraries as PDFs for easy sharing and offline access.",
    "Ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface with dark mode support across devices."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Firebase-based Authentication System supporting email/password and Google OAuth with protected routes.",
    "AI Itinerary Generator utilizing GROQ AI API to create personalized travel plans.",
    "Itinerary History Management enabling users to view, edit, and delete past itineraries.",
    "Interactive Google Maps integration displaying travel destinations and geocoded locations.",
    "PDF Export functionality for saving and sharing itineraries using HTML2Canvas and jsPDF libraries.",
    "REST API backend built with Django REST Framework for itinerary management and AI integration.",
    "Robust Data Models with PostgreSQL for production and SQLite for development.",
    "Responsive and accessible UI components styled with TailwindCSS supporting dark mode.",
    "Multi-environment configuration and containerized deployment using Docker and Docker Compose.",
    "Comprehensive error handling and input validation across frontend and backend layers."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User accesses the application and signs up or logs in using Firebase authentication (email/password or Google OAuth).",
    "Authenticated user navigates to the itinerary generation form, enters destination and travel duration.",
    "Frontend verifies authentication and submits the request to the backend API.",
    "Backend validates input, calls the GROQ AI API to generate the itinerary, saves the itinerary with user email, and returns the data.",
    "Frontend displays the generated itinerary with detailed daily plans and recommended activities.",
    "User can view their itinerary history, select itineraries to view, edit or delete, and export them as PDFs.",
    "Interactive maps display locations extracted and geocoded from itineraries for better visualization.",
    "User logs out or continues using the app, with protected routes ensuring security and session management."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "User authentication works correctly with email/password and Google OAuth, protecting routes and managing sessions.",
    "AI itinerary generation accurately creates travel plans based on destination and days input, and results are persisted and retrievable.",
    "Itinerary history allows users to view, create, update, and delete itineraries linked to their accounts.",
    "Interactive maps correctly display geocoded locations extracted from itineraries and update according to selected itineraries.",
    "PDF exports generate accurate and well-formatted documents representing the itinerary content.",
    "API endpoints validate and sanitize inputs and handle errors gracefully, ensuring data integrity and security.",
    "Responsive UI adapts appropriately to different device sizes and supports dark mode without usability issues.",
    "Dockerized deployment works seamlessly in development and production environments with correct environment configurations.",
    "Security measures, such as CORS, environment variable protection, and API key management, are implemented and effective.",
    "Performance is within acceptable limits, including AI API response times and application responsiveness."
