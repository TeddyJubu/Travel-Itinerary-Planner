  "product_overview": "AI Travel Itinerary Planner is a full-stack web application that enables users to generate personalized day-by-day travel itineraries using AI-driven technology. It offers user authentication, itinerary history management, interactive map visualization, and supports exporting itineraries to PDF files, ensuring a seamless and engaging travel planning experience.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide users with personalized, AI-generated travel itineraries based on destination and trip duration.",
    "Enable secure user authentication via Firebase with email/password and Google OAuth support.",
    "Allow users to save, retrieve, and manage their itinerary history conveniently.",
    "Offer downloadable PDF export capability of generated itineraries for offline access.",
    "Integrate an interactive map visualization for travel destinations and routes.",
    "Ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface with support for dark theme.",
    "Maintain secure and scalable backend services with Django REST Framework and PostgreSQL.",
    "Containerize the application using Docker for consistent multi-environment deployments."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Firebase-based authentication system supporting email/password and Google OAuth login.",
    "AI itinerary generation leveraging the GROQ API and OpenAI GPT models for personalized travel plans.",
    "User-specific itinerary storage and retrieval with CRUD operations exposed via REST API.",
    "PDF export functionality using HTML2Canvas and jsPDF for itinerary sharing or printing.",
    "Interactive map integration using Leaflet for displaying travel destinations and routes.",
    "Responsive React TypeScript frontend with TailwindCSS styling and dark mode support.",
    "Client-side routing with React Router including protected routes for authenticated users.",
    "Multi-environment database configuration using PostgreSQL for production and SQLite for development.",
    "Comprehensive state management with React Context for authentication and component states for itinerary data.",
    "Docker container orchestration for frontend, backend, and database services ensuring simplified deployment."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User signs up or logs in using Firebase authentication via email/password or Google OAuth.",
    "Upon authentication, user accesses the itinerary generation form and submits destination and trip duration input.",
    "Frontend verifies authentication and sends a POST request to the Django backend API including user email and travel details.",
    "Backend processes the request, invokes the GROQ AI API to generate a detailed travel itinerary, and saves the itinerary tied to the user email in the database.",
    "Backend responds with the generated itinerary data which frontend displays to the user.",
    "User can view their previously generated itineraries in the history section, fetched from the backend via user email query.",
    "User may download any itinerary as a PDF file using built-in export functionality.",
    "An interactive map view shows travel destinations and planned routes for enhanced visualization.",
    "User can log out, ending the authenticated session and protecting routes accordingly."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Successful user login and signup via Firebase authentication with proper state updates.",
    "Backend itineraries endpoint correctly generates AI itineraries with valid input and persists data in database.",
    "User-specific itinerary history is accurately retrieved and displayed by the frontend from backend API.",
    "Itinerary PDF export produces clear and correctly formatted documents matching displayed content.",
    "Interactive map correctly marks destinations and routes based on itinerary data.",
    "API endpoints implement appropriate input validation and return meaningful error messages on failure.",
    "Frontend routing protects sensitive pages and ensures only authenticated users can access personal data.",
    "Docker containers build and deploy with all services communicating as expected in dev and production environments.",
    "Environment variables and secrets such as GROQ API key and Firebase config are securely managed and not exposed unnecessarily.",
    "Performance requirements are met: AI response times are within 2-5 seconds and UI remains responsive during PDF generation and data fetching."
