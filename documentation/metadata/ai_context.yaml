  repository: "https://github.com/user/Travel-Itinerary-Planner"
  license: "MIT"
  created: "2024"
  last_updated: "2024-01-15"

capabilities:
  - "AI-powered travel itinerary generation using GROQ API"
  - "User authentication and session management via Firebase"
  - "Persistent storage of user itinerary history"
  - "PDF export functionality for generated itineraries"
  - "Responsive web interface with dark theme"

  - "Cross-platform compatibility (web browsers)"
  - "Real-time form validation and error handling"
  - "Markdown rendering for rich text itineraries"

limitations:
  - "No offline functionality - requires internet connection"
  - "Dependent on external GROQ API availability and rate limits"
  - "No user authentication integration between Firebase and Django backend"
  - "Limited to text-based itineraries (no maps or images)"
  - "No collaborative features or itinerary sharing"
  - "No mobile app - web-only interface"
  - "No caching mechanism for repeated requests"
  - "No user preference storage or personalization"
  - "No itinerary editing or modification features"
  - "No integration with booking platforms or travel APIs"

key_algorithms:
  - name: "AI Itinerary Generation"
    location: "backend/travel_app/views.py:ItineraryView.post"
    complexity: "O(1)"
    description: "Calls GROQ API with structured prompt to generate travel itinerary"
    dependencies: ["GROQ API", "requests library"]
  
  - name: "User History Retrieval"
    location: "backend/travel_app/views.py:HistoryView.get"
    complexity: "O(n)"
    description: "Queries database for user-specific itineraries ordered by creation date"
    dependencies: ["Django ORM", "PostgreSQL"]
  
  - name: "PDF Generation"
    location: "frontend/src/components/ItineraryForm.tsx:exportToPDF"
    complexity: "O(n)"
    description: "Converts HTML content to canvas then to PDF using html2canvas and jsPDF"

  - name: "Firebase Authentication"
    location: "frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx"
    complexity: "O(1)"
    description: "Manages user authentication state and provides auth methods"
    dependencies: ["Firebase Auth SDK"]

performance_considerations:
  - "GROQ API response time: 2-5 seconds per request"
  - "PDF generation performance depends on itinerary length and browser capabilities"
  - "Database queries are simple and fast with proper indexing"
  - "Frontend bundle size: ~2MB including all dependencies"
  - "No pagination implemented for history view - could impact performance with many itineraries"
  - "No request caching - each itinerary generation hits the AI API"
  - "Firebase Auth adds ~500KB to bundle size"
  - "React rendering performance good for typical use cases"

security_notes:
  - "Firebase API keys exposed in frontend code (standard practice for client-side auth)"
  - "GROQ API key properly secured in backend environment variables"
  - "No backend validation of Firebase tokens - security vulnerability"
  - "CORS configured for specific origins only"
  - "No rate limiting implemented on backend endpoints"
  - "SQL injection protected by Django ORM"
  - "XSS protection via React's built-in escaping"
  - "No HTTPS enforcement in development mode"
  - "User data associated by email only - no strong user identification"
  - "No input sanitization for AI prompts - potential for prompt injection"
